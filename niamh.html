    <tr>
      <td>This was a university project aimed at identifying and resolving a
        problem presented by electric cars in modern society. By using an
        innovation framework, I collaborated within an interdisciplinary team,
        to devise a work-based car lending scheme designed to market electric
        cars to the professional worker.
        <br>
        I learnt how to work in a team and how to leverage team capabilities to
        create a successful project. I led the product pitch at the end of the
        challenge which developed my presentation skills and highlighted the
        importance of team communication in creating a successful launch.

      <th>Ping Pong Ball Launcher Project, University of Bath</th>

    <tr>
      <td>The brief given, was to design a mechanically operated ping pong ball
        launcher that launched three balls different specified lengths, as part
        of a group of 5. Through this, I utilised different concept generation
        and selection methods to design a working model which we then
        manufactured in the following semester.
        <br>
       Through this project I developed my report writing skills and improved
       my CAD skills. I paid particular attention to my part and assembly
       drawings which I then used to assemble the project in the second semester.

      <td>In preparation for my labs I researched the theory underlining the
        practical through library and online resources. Therefore, at the time
        of the lab I would ask the lecturer any questions that I thought would
        be pertinent to the lab report. The reports themselves required clear
        and concise writing and I developed my research skills.
