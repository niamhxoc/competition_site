<p> I was featured in an article in Refinery29
  <a href= "https://www.refinery29.com/en-gb/racism-discrimination-university-uk";>
      <p><strong> '3 Young Women On Dealing With Racism At British Universities'</strong></p>
</a href>
<br>
<p><strong>Can you describe your experience with racism at university?</strong></p>
<p><i>"Coming to university was the first time I really felt aware of my ethnicity. Experiences of racism that I have faced have sometimes been outrightly offensive. For example, people casually using slurs like 'chinky' and 'Japs' on a group chat that I was in in my first year and thinking that it was 'just a joke'. When I said that it was unacceptable, no one stood up for me. My boyfriend at the time actually said that I was overreacting and I should make more effort to be friends with his friends. "Sometimes the experiences are so normalised that I don’t even feel able to protest, to use Heather Savigny’s term, there is a 'drip drip' effect of small incidents of racism that cumulate and create this culture where racial harassment is a common occurrence for students. Things like, people on nights out demanding to know where I’m from, and not being satisfied with my answer: 'Err, Cheltenham.'"</i></p>

<p><strong>Were there any isolated incidents of racism, and if so, can you describe your experience?</strong></p>
<p><i>"A senior lecturer in my department asked where I was from, and then called me 'exotic'."</i></p>

<p><strong>Did you report the incident, and if so, what was your university's response at the time?</strong></p>
<p><i>"The disciplinary process was bureaucratic and draining, I found myself having to repeat the story again and again. I had to have a one hour interview with an investigation panel made up of three people, who were unfriendly and used complicated terminology that I didn’t really understand. I waited months to hear back from the investigation. I finally got the university’s outcome that the evidence heard from my lecturer indicated that he was describing the country of Korea as 'exotic', nothing personal about me, and 'it is therefore found that there was no discrimination based on race'.
"In using the formal disciplinary process, I tried to 'speak in' to the institution – as opposed to 'calling out' the uni publicly – by giving them the opportunity to provide a satisfactory outcome, but it didn’t work. I think that this shows not only the culture of normalising racism on campus, but the structural racism within the institution that needs sorting out."</i></p>

<p><strong>How did it make you feel?</strong></p>
<p><i>""I went on to set up a small project called 'Everyday Racism Bath' which was an online space where, particularly my women of colour friends, could share their experience of racism and micro-aggressions. This turned into the NUS' ‘my racist campus’ campaign last year. I also helped advise the equality, diversity and inclusion team at Bath with their #NeverOK campaign, and on staff training for unconscious bias.
"I went on to do my placement year at the Race Equality Foundation which is a fantastic small charity in London. Now I am in my final undergraduate year, and supporting and taking part in a funded programme at my university on the subject ‘addressing hate crime in higher education’."</i></p>
