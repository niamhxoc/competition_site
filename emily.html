<p> I was featured in an article <strong> '3 Young Women On Dealing With Racism At British Universities'</strong></p>
<br>
<p>Can you describe your experience with racism at university?
<p><i>"Coming to university was the first time I really felt aware of my ethnicity. Experiences of racism that I have faced have sometimes been outrightly offensive. For example, people casually using slurs like 'chinky' and 'Japs' on a group chat that I was in in my first year and thinking that it was 'just a joke'. When I said that it was unacceptable, no one stood up for me. My boyfriend at the time actually said that I was overreacting and I should make more effort to be friends with his friends.</i></p>
