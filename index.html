    <p> I am currently a second year Mechanical Engineering student at the <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/homepage/">University of Bath</a>.
        I was born in Watford but have lived in Tring my whole life.
        <br>
        You can see my hometown on the left, I lived in a 3 bed in the North of the town, around <em> New Mill.</em>
        <br>
        I moved out of this house in July 2018 and it was honestly the most heartbreaking day of my life so far.
