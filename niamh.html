      <td>This was a university project aimed at identifying and resolving a
        problem presented by electric cars in modern society. By using an
        innovation framework, I collaborated within an interdisciplinary team,
        to devise a work-based car lending scheme designed to market electric
        cars to the professional worker.
        <br>
        I learnt how to work in a team and how to leverage team capabilities to
        create a successful project. I led the product pitch at the end of the
        challenge which developed my presentation skills and highlighted the
        importance of team communication in creating a successful launch.

      <td>The brief given, was to design a mechanically operated ping pong ball
        launcher that launched three balls different specified lengths, as part
        of a group of 5. Through this, I utilised different concept generation
        and selection methods to design a working model which we then
        manufactured in the following semester.
        <br>
       Through this project I developed my report writing skills and improved
       my CAD skills. I paid particular attention to my part and assembly
       drawings which I then used to assemble the project in the second semester.

        be pertinent to the lab report. The reports themselves required clear
        and concise writing and I developed my research skills.

    <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>I am taking part in the CodeFirst: Girls course and through this I am
        using html and CSS to build my own websites. I improve the code in
        between sessions as I enjoy seeing the improvement of my sites.</li>
      <li>During analysis of lab session data, I used MATLAB. I would present
        the data in a suitable figure or table, constructed using different
        commands. I have continued to develop my skills in second year through
        the Modelling Techniques module where I use code to model and solve
        problems with Differential Equations.</li>
      <li>utilised Autodesk Inventor in both first- and second-year projects.
        I have gotten involved using more complex tools and streamlining my
        process of making parts and adding them to assemblies.</li>
      <li>Proficient in the use of Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint and
        Publisher.</li>
      <li>Knowledge of Adobe Photoshop.</li>
